## Project Idea :bulb:

A movie recommendation system based on past viewing activities, similar to Netflix and YouTube. This feature currently doesn’t exist on Jellyfin, and Jellyfin only has access to movies on the user's device, instead of all the film out there. So we can connect the system to IMDB so we can recommend new films that the user can then purchase and rip to their device. 

## Progress :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### 2025-11-20

This project has undergone a significant update to enhance the user interface as well as fixing various bugs. The frontend has been completely revamped using Next.js, and the Express.js backend is removed in favor of a more streamlined architecture. To checkout a hosted version of the app, visit [https://jrh1823rhui34y8.gzuo.me/login](https://jrh1823rhui34y8.gzuo.me/login).

Here are the updated screenshots of the project:

### 2024-9-11

The project is mostly considered complete, and you can find the github repository here: [Github Repo Link](https://github.com/zzuo123/jellyrec)

It consists of the following components:
- **frontend/**: A Svelte frontend that connects to the backend and displays the recommended movies
- **backend/**: An Express backend that connects to the Jellyfin server as well as a python Flask server that serves the recommendation system
- **recommendation_experiments/**: A collection of Jupyter notebooks that I used to experiment with different recommendation systems, it's pretty disorganized but contains some useful code snippets that can be improved upon

Here are some screenshots of the project:

A user can login with their Jellyfin credentials, and the app will recommend movies based on their viewing history. The recommendation system is a simple collaborative filtering system that uses the MovieLens dataset.

## Scope :dart:

### JF Plugin vs. Web App

My original idea was to create a Jellyfin Plugin and then directly use the task scheduler feature in Jellyfin. However, writing a Jellyfin Plugin requires using dotnet, which I am not familiar with. So instead I will create a web app that will connect to the Jellyfin server using its API and then recommend movies to the user through a web interface. Another benefit of this approach is that it can show movies that are not on the user's device, but are available on the internet. 

### Recommendation System

As for the recommendation system, that part is still under research and I will get back to the project later. Currently, I am thinking of two approaches:

1. Use a readily available recommendation system library, such as [Surprise](https://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and train it on the user's viewing history.

2. Create my own recommendation system using a neural network, and train it on the user's viewing history. However, this approach is more complex and time-consuming, so I am not sure if I will go with this approach. The upside is that I get more experience with neural networks.

{% capture notice %}
#### Model-based filtering (collaborative filtering)
- Recommendation based on other user’s rating
- Jellyfin doesn’t have ratings, but have favorites, so favorites gets 5 (really like), other gets 3 (meh, have not watched yet/don’t really like). No movie assigned 0 since user won’t keep a movie they don’t like
{% endcapture %}

### Training Data

Since my own jellyfin server is only for myself and a few family members, the training data will be limited. So I am thinking of using public datasets like the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset to train the recommendation system. 

## Tech Stack :computer:

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Running the project:

Update (11/20/2025): To streamline the installation process, Docker is now used to run the project. To install docker, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To test if Docker is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
Docker version <Version>, build <Build Number>
```

To run the project, you first need to clone the Github Repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zzuo123/jellyrec.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and follow the following the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/zzuo123/jellyrec/blob/master/README.md) file to get started:

```bash
cd jellyrec/

# on Linux or MAC
cat README.md
# on Windows
notepad.exe README.md
# follow the instructions there to set up and run the project
```

After that, you can access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or whichever port the frontend server is running on.

Try it out and let me know what you think! :smile:
